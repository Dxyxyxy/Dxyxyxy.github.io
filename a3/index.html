            <p>The theme of my page is the appreciation of Monet's work. For the information
                 design aspect, I have mainly focused on the main page, because when looking 
                 at a painting you need to see more details about the work in order to understand 
                 it better, so next to the work there is a simple table introduction and the main 
                 story behind the painter's work in order for the viewer to understand the mood of 
                 the painting better. For the playful aspect, I have reflected this in several places
                  on the page. The general information pages are mostly boring. So I created a digital 
                  transformation effect on the loading page at the beginning to increase the viewer's 
                  interest when opening the page. The viewer will feel curious when seeing the time change, 
                  and once the page is opened, I made a parallax effect with three famous Monet paintings 
                  to make a three-dimensional presentation and increase the visual effect. The text will 
                  only appear if the mouse touches the button in the details section, which also adds to 
                  the playfulness of the page. The interspersed effect of the page like a PowerPoint and 
                  the switch between photos are part of the design, both adding to the richness and playfulness of the page.</p>

                        <p>Monet planted gardens wherever he lived. When he rented this house at Vétheuil, he made
                            arrangements
                            with the owner to landscape the terraces, which lead down to the Seine. The boy with the
                            wagon
                            is
                            Monet's young son, and on the steps behind him are other members of his extended household.

                        <p>On the path, the brilliant sunlight is dappled with shade that falls in blues, plums, and

                            greens. Figures and faces are defined —briefly— with color. The large flowerpots were
                            Monet's,
                            and
                            he took them with him each time he moved, using them in other gardens. They are "blue and
                            white"
                            only in our understanding: examined up close they are blue and green where they reflect the
                            grass
                            behind them, elsewhere tinged with gold or pink.</p>

                        <p>Early in 1884, Claude Monet traveled to Bordighera, a town on the Italian Riviera, close to
                            the
                            border between Italy and France, for a working visit of three weeks that turned into nearly
                            three months. In a letter to the sculptor Auguste Rodin describing his efforts to translate
                            into
                            paint the brilliant Mediterranean light, Monet declared he was "fencing, wrestling, with the
                            sun."</p>
                        <p>Although he was entranced by the light and by the unfamiliar plants and trees in the south,
                            Monet
                            had difficulty in finding motifs. At Bordighera it seemed that everything was overgrown and
                            he
                            was tormented by the suspicion that he was in the wrong place. Often under these
                            circumstances
                            Monet would make conventional picturesque views as if to prepare himself for future
                            exertions.
                            In Bordighera, 1884, the windswept lines of the pine trees make a frame for the distant town
                            in
                            a painting that takes us back to sentimental souvenirs of the Grand Tour.</p>

                        <p>In the autumn 1886 Claude Monet sought out rugged and barren terrain on the island of
                            Belle-Île-en-Mer off the coast of Brittany. Centering his activity in the village of
                            Kervilahouen on the Atlantic side of the island, he wrote to fellow Impressionist Gustave
                            Caillebotte, “I live been here a month, and I am grinding away; I am in a magnificent region of
                            wilderness, a tremendous heap of rocks and sea unbelievable for its colors; well, I am very
                            enthusiastic.” Still, Monet confessed to having trouble painting the wild ocean because he
                            was
                            used to painting the calmer channel waters.In "Rocks at Belle-Île, Port-Domois," Monet
                            depicted
                            the grim sea beating away at the barren rocks, a theme he repeated and varied numerous
                            times. He
                            was sensitive to the topography of his surroundings and the need to alter his manner of
                            looking
                            accordingly. He wrote to his companion Alice Hoschedé, “I must make great efforts to make
                            them
                            [the rocks] somber, to render this sinister, tragic aspect.” He added that he felt
                            “powerless to
                            render the intensity” of the ocean crashing upon the rocky sentinels of the island. Yet he
                            also
                            recognized that he placed great demands on himself: “I am chasing the merest sliver of color.
                            It is my own fault, I want to grasp the intangible.” The colors, forms, and atmosphere of
                            this
                            magnificent painting reveal that Monet was concerned as much with conveying turbulent
                            emotion as
                            with recording the appearance of a particular site.</p>

                        <p>“I am painting the town of Antibes,” Monet wrote to his companion, Alice Hoschedé, in
                            January,
                            1888, “a little fortified town all golden in the sun that stands out against beautiful blue
                            and
                            pink mountains and the eternally snow-capped range of the Alps.” Monet is stay at Antibes,
                            between Nice and Cannes on the French Riviera, lasted from January to May, allowing him to
                            avoid
                            the dreariest months of the year in Northern France and to satisfy his dealer is appetite for
                            idyllic, sun-drenched seascapes.</p>

                        <p>Between 1871 and 1878 Claude Monet lived in Argenteuil—an idyllic suburb on the Seine that

                            noticeably transformed by industrialization in the vicinity of the capital. The promenade
