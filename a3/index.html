            <p>The theme of my page is an appreciation collection about Monet's work. 
                I chose Information Design and Playful. in terms of information design, 
                the main place where I showed this was concentrated on all the home pages, 
                which have a lot of detailed textual information material. Because the viewer
                 wants to see more details and information about each painting as they look at 
                 it in order to better understand and feel it, there is a normal table presentation
                  next to each work and a button to click and read the main story behind Monet's
                   work in order to give the viewer a better understanding of what the artist was 
                   feeling at the time he painted it. For the playful aspect, I have reflected this
                    in many places on the pages I have created. For general information pages are
                     mostly boring. So I created a digital transition effect on the loading page 
                     at the beginning to increase the interest of the viewer when opening the page,
                      the viewer gets curious when they see the numbers change and this animation 
                      adds to the fun. Upon entering the page, I chose three famous Monet paintings 
                      (Water Lilies) all from the same series and made a 3D parallax effect to add 
                      visual effect and playability to the viewer, an effect that can be used to enhance 
                      and feel the Monet work. And for the information section, a common effect is also 
                      used, where the text only appears when the mouse touches the button, which also adds
                       to the interactivity of the page. There are two other detailed sections in the page, 
                       after each of the two detailed paintings there is an animation effect, one that
                        naturally switches between the different works like a video. The other is a dynamic 
                        browsing map, where several paintings can also be linked together to slide left and 
                        right on the page, depending on how the page is swiped up and down. For the whole page,
                         all the paintings and text pages are interspersed with effects like a PPT and the 
                         switching between photos is part of the design, and these many animations and effects 
                         add to the richness and interest of the page. For the colour scheme, I wanted to use
                          a theme of light and dark colours based on Monet's work. I chose light grey-blue and
                           dark blue as the background and word colour, and used a light green as an aid to set
                            them off and enrich the image, the light green and dark blue feel like the image 
                            will be very rich and interesting, but also to meet the playful effect. For the 
                            layout of the pages, I used a minimalist typography, wanting to give the viewer
                             a clear picture, after all, there is a lot of information to read. So in the process 
                             of designing and completing the page, I designed and laid out the page first and then 
                             implemented it step by step, so that the interactive page would fit in with my theme 
                             and would be relevant to the two key words I had chosen, information design and playful.</p>

                        <p>Monet planted gardens wherever he lived. When he rented this house at Vétheuil, he made
                            arrangements
                            with the owner to landscape the terraces, which lead down to the Seine. The boy with the
                            wagon
                            is
                            Monet's young son, and on the steps behind him are other members of his extended household.

                        <p>On the path, the brilliant sunlight is dappled with shade that falls in blues, plums, and
                            various
                            greens. Figures and faces are defined —briefly— with color. The large flowerpots were
                            Monet's,
                            and
                            he took them with him each time he moved, using them in other gardens. They are "blue and
                            white"
                            only in our understanding: examined up close they are blue and green where they reflect the
                            grass
                            behind them, elsewhere tinged with gold or pink.</p>

                        <p>Early in 1884, Claude Monet traveled to Bordighera, a town on the Italian Riviera, close to
                            the
                            border between Italy and France, for a working visit of three weeks that turned into nearly
                            three months. In a letter to the sculptor Auguste Rodin describing his efforts to translate
                            into
                            paint the brilliant Mediterranean light, Monet declared he was "fencing, wrestling, with the
                            sun."</p>
                        <p>Although he was entranced by the light and by the unfamiliar plants and trees in the south,
                            Monet
                            had difficulty in finding motifs. At Bordighera it seemed that everything was overgrown and
                            he
                            was tormented by the suspicion that he was in the wrong place. Often under these
                            circumstances
                            Monet would make conventional picturesque views as if to prepare himself for future
                            exertions.
                            In Bordighera, 1884, the windswept lines of the pine trees make a frame for the distant town
                            in
                            a painting that takes us back to sentimental souvenirs of the Grand Tour.</p>

                        <p>In the autumn 1886 Claude Monet sought out rugged and barren terrain on the island of
                            Belle-Île-en-Mer off the coast of Brittany. Centering his activity in the village of
                            Kervilahouen on the Atlantic side of the island, he wrote to fellow Impressionist Gustave
                            Caillebotte, “I live been here a month, and I am grinding away; I am in a magnificent region of
                            wilderness, a tremendous heap of rocks and sea unbelievable for its colors; well, I am very
                            enthusiastic.” Still, Monet confessed to having trouble painting the wild ocean because he
                            was
                            used to painting the calmer channel waters.In "Rocks at Belle-Île, Port-Domois," Monet
                            depicted
                            the grim sea beating away at the barren rocks, a theme he repeated and varied numerous
                            times. He
                            was sensitive to the topography of his surroundings and the need to alter his manner of
                            looking
                            accordingly. He wrote to his companion Alice Hoschedé, “I must make great efforts to make
                            them
                            [the rocks] somber, to render this sinister, tragic aspect.” He added that he felt
                            “powerless to
                            render the intensity” of the ocean crashing upon the rocky sentinels of the island. Yet he
                            also
                            recognized that he placed great demands on himself: “I am chasing the merest sliver of color.
                            It is my own fault, I want to grasp the intangible.” The colors, forms, and atmosphere of
                            this
                            magnificent painting reveal that Monet was concerned as much with conveying turbulent
                            emotion as
                            with recording the appearance of a particular site.</p>

                        <p>“I am painting the town of Antibes,” Monet wrote to his companion, Alice Hoschedé, in
                            January,
                            1888, “a little fortified town all golden in the sun that stands out against beautiful blue
                            and
                            pink mountains and the eternally snow-capped range of the Alps.” Monet is stay at Antibes,
                            between Nice and Cannes on the French Riviera, lasted from January to May, allowing him to
                            avoid
                            the dreariest months of the year in Northern France and to satisfy his dealer is appetite for
                            idyllic, sun-drenched seascapes.</p>
