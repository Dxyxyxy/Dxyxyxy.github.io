  /* When designing this page, my first thought was to design a youthful and energetic 
  page that fits the profiles of young people. When it comes to youth, I think of green, 
  and then I think of forests. The two preferred colors in the woods are green and brown.
   I use brown as the background color of the entire page, and in the CSS design, green is
    used as the key color of the box. I used gradients for each box because the forest is 
    also colorful and has different color combinations. I also added a lot of different borders, 
    adding variety and diversification. For the CSS layout, I chose a very simple and well-proportioned 
    layout. Layers of trees that also fit my forest theme and a trunk. Such a sequential position 
    can quickly find the key point. */
